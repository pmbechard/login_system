# loginSystem
A system for logins and signups 
- can sign up following standard sign up conditions (passwoard chars, username length, email format, etc.)
- it stores your email, username and password, allows you to sign back in after closing/reopening

- would like to find a way to secure user information in the future (and obviously no locally)
